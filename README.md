# RamanSpec_BasicOperations
This repository contains the procedures for mentioned job needed in day to day analysis of spectra. For example, spectra for vibrational spectroscopy etc.. obtained using a constructed sysem using PI's WinSpec. ( Files to load PI's .spe file are NOT included ).

1. average_2D.ipf : Procedure to average selected 2-D waves in a folder keep the averaged data in the 'averaged data' folder. More than one 2-D wave maybe selected.
2. plot_2D.ipf : Takes a 2D wave and plots all the individual columns against the points, with some constant off set, or wavemax deepndent offset.
