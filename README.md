# RamanSpec_BasicOperations
This repository contains the procedures for mentioned job needed in day to day analysis of spectra. For example, spectra for vibrational spectroscopy etc.. obtained using a constructed sysem using PI's WinSpec. ( Files to load PI's .spe file are NOT included ).

1. Procedure to average selected 2-D waves in a folder and then avearge each of them and keep in 'Averaged data' folder. More than one 2-D wave maybe selected.
