This repository contains the procedures for mentioned job needed in day to day analysis of spectra. For example, spectra for vibrational spectroscopy etc... The procedures are for analyzing raw data (x,y columns) but might be useful for wide variety of purposes.

1. average_2D.ipf : Procedure to average selected 2-D waves in a folder keep the averaged data in the 'averaged data' folder. More than one 2-D wave maybe selected.
2. plot_2D.ipf : Takes a 2D wave and plots all the individual columns against the points, with some constant off set, or wavemax deepndent offset.
