`Curve_fitting_Gaussian.pxp`  is a packed Igor experiment file containing three one-dimensional waves. One as the xaxis and the rest two as gaussian peaks with some noise and baseline. Can be used to study baseline fitting.



`fitting_many_gaussians` consists of a 2D wave having gaussians of different parameters which have to fit.
